Currently, I am working on canine cognition, in particular, using fMRI to understand the origins of social cognition in the dog brain. Using comparative neuroscience and behavior research as a tool, an overarching goal of my work is understanding brain evolution.

My other research projects include: understanding non-conspecific perception; music cognition (chord perception and formation of music predictions in children with autism); and memory research (see my PhD publications).
